# Rule-based-chatbot

This project is a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python and pandas. It uses a sales dataset that contains details like branch, date, day, session, order type, items, category, quantity, and sales. The chatbot can answer simple queries such as total sales, sales by branch, sales of a particular item, and quantity sold. The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to interact with sales data using simple text-based rules.
